# Islands

This repository contains a JavaScript project to generate deterministic and random art work.
This is object-oriented programmation, with classes created for leaves, trees, rocks etc.
The level of randomness can be changed in the parameters, with for example the colours, densities of plants, position of the rocks, etc.
